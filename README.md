The goal of `NMRcycling` is to be an addition to the chapter *NMR based
Metabolomics: monitoring physiological response to physical exercise* in
the book XXX. This package contains the data and functions to work with
the data.

[GitHub](https://github.com/ricoderks/NMRcycling) with:

## Online version

You can also run the NMRcycling notebook on Google Colab. No software
installation necessary, you only need a Google account. Just go to 
[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1a71rNVgBCjXN-OeUnPt15IvdPgydXYXz?usp=sharing),
copy the notebook to your own account and click "Run all" in the
