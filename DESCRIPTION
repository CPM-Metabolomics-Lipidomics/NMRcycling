Description: The goal of `NMRcycling` is to provide the R code that is described 
 in the chapter *NMR based Metabolomics monitoring physiological response
  to physical exercise* in the book *A Practical Guide to Metabolomics
  Applications in Health and Disease*. This package contains the script
  and the functions to work with the NMR data.
