\title{Perform Probabilistic Quotient Normalization}
\usage{
pqn(X, n = "median", QC = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{matrix to normalize samples * variables (rows * columns)}

\item{n}{normalization reference: "mean" for using the overall average of variables as reference
or "median" (default) for using the overall median of variables as reference}

\item{QC}{vector of number(s) to specify samples which average to use as reference
(e.g. QC samples)}
}
\value{
Normalized table samples * variables (rows * columns)
}
\description{
Perform Probabilistic Quotient Normalization
}
\details{
First a total area normalization should be done before PQN is applied.
